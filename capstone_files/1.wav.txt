I was wondering if you'd like to go out to dinner on Thursday. I kind of go out on Thursday. I'm busy. Are you busy on Friday? I am busy on Friday. That's too bad. Are you busy next week? nothing Yes, I am but I'll be free next Wednesday. Perhaps you be interested in going out to dinner. Sounds lovely great. We'll have dinner together next Wednesday.
