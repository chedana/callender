Hello sisters Hair Salon Trinity speaking, I help you. I'd like to make an appointment, please. What do you need to have done? Well, I'd like to have my hair cut and styled. When should you come in? Do you have anything available for Saturday morning? Let me just look. Yes, we do. How about 10:45? That would be fine. Can you give me your name, please? Yes, it's Julie. That's Jolie. Thank you. Miss Jolie. We look forward to seeing you.
