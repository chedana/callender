This is both County clinic. How may I help you? My name is Karen Wilson. I like to make an appointment. Have you been here before? Yes, once I saw Doctor Johnson. What do you need to see the doctor about? I was walking my dog and I tripped my foot is swollen, and I'm not sure what's wrong with it. We can get you in on Thursday afternoon. I'm worried. Waiting I think my foot might be broken. Dr. Johnson is out today with Doctor Peters might be able to see you. That would be great. Can I put you on hold? Yes, that's fine. Alyssa comes back on the line shortly. I can squeeze you in at 4 this afternoon. All right, I have new insurance. Just bring your insurance card with you. Will get you set up.
