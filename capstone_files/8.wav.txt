Hi Joan. What are you doing today? You mean after church he have any plans. No, not really no plans. Let's go for a movie Wish movie. Well, I was thinking about the new movie Norwegian Wood, but I don't mind if you want to watch something else. I saw the trailer for this movie. It seems to be a good one.
