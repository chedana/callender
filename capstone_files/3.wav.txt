Hello. Can I make an appointment over the phone? Can I make an appointment for 7 a.m. On Wednesday? I'm sorry. You cannot make an appointment for that time? Why not the office does not open until 9 a.m. I see. Can I make the appointment for 11:30 a.m. Yes, 11:30 a.m. On Wednesday should be fine. Thank you. You're welcome.
